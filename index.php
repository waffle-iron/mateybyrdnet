				<h5>HI THERE</h5>
				This subdomain of my website is used for development, if you wish to see the current stable version of my website look <a href="mateybyrd.net">here</a>. If you stay here please note that this version of the site is in development and receives all minor updates that I make to it, this means that some parts might not look or work as they should.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h5>ROADMAP</h5>
				Since this domain is used for development I have made a small list of
			things that I am working on, this list will change over the course of
			time.
				<ul>
					<li><s>Auto update system</s></li>
					<li>Information about me ;)</li>
					<li>Nice layout (working on it)</li>
				</ul>
