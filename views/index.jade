        h4 Welcome sir/madam
        p.text I would like to welcome you to my humble website.
        p.text First of all let me introduce myself, I am Nick Belzer (known online as Matey Byrd), I live in the Netherlands and am currently 17 years old. I started programming at the age of 10 when I became interested in making games, first of all using Game Maker, then came Java and throughout the years I teached myself how to program. Currenlty I am familiar with quite a few languages and I am mainly working on web and game development.

              h5.subtitle A Modern Chess Game
              p.text Together with Petr Kollarcik I made a chess game for iOS, the goal was to give the chess board a modern look and stand out of the crowd in that way. 
              p.text Petr did the design work while I worked on the game itself, in my opinion Petr did a great job and I did my best to create a game that lived up to his concept for the game. After about half a year of development the game finaly released on the App Store in December 2015. 
              p.text The game has quite a few features, including single and multiplayer gameplay, a computer player, different sets, a timed game mode and more.

              h5.subtitle My Personal Website
              p.text For some time now I have had my own website and this has been an ongoing adventure of testing out new tricks I learned and just learning how to develop websites. It has been somewhat frustrating but a lot of fun to struggle with all the css, html, php and javascript.
              p.text Currently this website is build upon NodeJS using Express as web server. 
              p.text The website is and probably will always be under development because there will always be new things to try out. Therefore the look of the site could change overnight ;).
